# Resources

Here is a list of resources related to ENGIN-2223.

## Microchip[^1] / AVR Resources

- [ATmega328P Datasheet](https://doctor-pasquale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ATmega328P.pdf) This datasheet is probably the most useful resource that you have access to for learning more about the AVR microcontroller. This datasheet contains information on virtually every topic that we cover in class.
- [AVR Instruction Set Manual](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-0856-AVR-Instruction-Set-Manual.pdf) This document contains every instruction allowed on AVR microcontrollers. We cover many of these in class, so this becomes a very useful guide.
- [AVR Fuse Calculator](https://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc/) Use this online tool to determine fuse settings when programming any AVR microcontroller chip.
- [AVR Interrupts](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html) This website has the name of every interrupt vector. Sometimes the name of the same interrupt vector is different on different microcontrollers. In case you are using something different from the ATmega328P, you may want to reference this if your interrupt isnâ€™t working.

[^1]: Microchip bought out Atmel, the original producer of the AVR family of microcontrollers. Some of the datasheets may still say Atmel.
