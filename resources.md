# Resources

Here is a list of resources related to ENGIN-2223.

## Microchip[^1] / AVR Resources

- [ATmega328P Datasheet](https://doctor-pasquale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ATmega328P.pdf) This datasheet is probably the most useful resource that you have access to for learning more about the AVR microcontroller. This datasheet contains information on virtually every topic that we cover in class.
- [AVR Instruction Set Manual](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-0856-AVR-Instruction-Set-Manual.pdf) This document contains every instruction allowed on AVR microcontrollers. We cover many of these in class, so this becomes a very useful guide.
- [AVR Fuse Calculator](https://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc/) Use this online tool to determine fuse settings when programming any AVR microcontroller chip.
- [AVR Interrupts](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html) This website has the name of every interrupt vector. Sometimes the name of the same interrupt vector is different on different microcontrollers. In case you are using something different from the ATmega328P, you may want to reference this if your interrupt isn‚Äôt working.

[^1]: Microchip bought out Atmel (the original producer of the AVR family of microcontrollers) in 2016. Some of the datasheets or other references herein may still say Atmel.

## Arduino

- [Arduino Uno R3 Schematic](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Arduino_Uno_Rev3-schematic.pdf) A complete pin-by-pin look at the Arduino Uno[^2] and how it interfaces with the ATmega328P microcontroller.
- [Arduino Board Pin Reference](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/uno-rev3/intro-to-board/) Explains all of the pins on the Arduino Uno board.
- [Cheater Functions Explained](http://garretlab.web.fc2.com/en/arduino/inside/index.html) This website explains the C code behind all of the Arduino ‚Äúcheater functions‚Äù (that you are definitely not allowed to use in class). See how much bloat is included in these functions that we eliminate by using C.

[^2]: Note that there are two microcontrollers on the Arduino Uno R3. The ATmega328P is the MCU that you program. The ATmega16U2 is a microcontroller included to facilitate code transfer to the ATmega328P over USB.

## Simulation, Schematics and Flowchart Tools

- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org) My personal favorite schematic tool. Supplement with [my library of KiCad parts](KiCAD) for components you can't get in the basic library.
- [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) Eagle is another great tool that can be used to create PCBs and also has a schematic editor. This should be your go-to if you want to create a printed circuit board from your design.
- [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) TinkerCAD is an online simulation tool that allows you to simulate digital logic chips as well as do some software coding with the Arduino Uno. Information about TinkerCAD and its limitations is included in [DoctorPCOD/labs](labs) here on GitHub.
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) A nice app for creating flowcharts or block diagrams.

## Binary Codes

- [ASCII Code](https://www.ascii-code.com) A full table of ASCII code values in decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal.

## ADC

- üé• Coming Soon: A video with a warning about using the ADC if you have to change the input channel in ADMUX.
- [Understanding ADC Parameters](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/atmel-8456-8-and-32-bit-avr-microcontrollers-avr127-understanding-adc-parameters_application-note.pdf) This application note from Microchip goes over the basic concepts of the ADC used in AVR 8-bit microcontrollers, and in particular delves into ADC error in a bit of detail.
- [ADC of megaAVR in Single-Ended Mode](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/AN2538-ADC-of-megaAVR-in-SingleEnded-Mode-00002538A.pdf) This application note from Microchip explains the single-ended successive-approximation register ADC used on the megaAVR microcontrollers.

## CPU Clock

- [Choosing a Microcontroller Clock](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/choosing-the-right-oscillator-for-your-microcontroller/) An explanation of different types of oscillators and how to choose the right clock for your microcontroller project.

## Timer/Counter

- üé• [Input Capture Unit YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/eXE-8X38AHs) A video I made about the input capture unit. At the end it discusses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

## Memory

- [NAND and NOR Flash](https://www.embedded.com/flash-101-nand-flash-vs-nor-flash/) The differences between NAND and NOR flash memory.

## Measurement Tools

- [How to Use an Oscilloscope](https://www.sparkfuneducation.com/how-to/how-to-use-an-oscilloscope.html) If using a ‚Äòscope intimidates you, check out this reference that breaks it down into simple steps.
- [Oscilloscope Video (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrw1PiU-Uow) I made a video on using the oscilloscope for circuit analysis students. It will walk you through the basics.
- [Oscilloscope Triggering (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJG-hE7xms8) I made a video on triggering the oscilloscope, which is particularly useful if the dancing sinusoids are driving you crazy.

## Debugging

- [A Feynman approach to debugging](https://www.embedded.com/a-feynman-approach-to-debugging/) This article from embedded.com presents a debugging scenario that may be familiar to microcontrollers students.
- üìò _If I Only Changed the Software, Why Is the Phone on Fire?_ by Lisa Simone ‚Äì Along the same lines as the above example, this book is non-fiction but written in a story-like manner following software developers who have to debug and fix embedded systems projects. Some of the examples should be familiar to you if you‚Äôve ever used a timer/counter ISR or unsigned char variables!

## C Resources

- [Guide to Software Commenting](https://www.ganssle.com/commenting.htm) Helpful advice on how to comment your software code.

## Assembly Resources

- [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio) This is the definitive IDE for use with AVR microcontrollers. You can code in C and AVR assembly using this IDE. This would be our go-to IDE if it were easier to upload code onto the Arduino from this program. However, this IDE is required when writing AVR assembly. The IDE is free and highly recommended if you plan to write assembly code at home, or want to program for non-Arduino microcontrollers.
- [AVR Delay Loop Calculator](http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI4M/AVRdelay.html) Want to create a delay in your AVR assembly code and don‚Äôt know how? Put in your microcontroller clock frequency and desired delay time and this handy tool will spit out the necessary code to achieve that delay.[^3]
- [View Arduino IDE Code in Assembly](http://rcarduino.blogspot.com/2012/09/how-to-view-arduino-assembly.html) If you‚Äôre interested in how the Arduino IDE translates your C code to Assembly, follow these steps to look at the output. You‚Äôll see that the Arduino IDE severely bloats your code with a lot of unnecessary instructions that you can eliminate by writing Assembly directly.[^4]

[^3]: Make sure the general purpose registers used in creating your delay aren't registers that you're otherwise using in your assembly code, otherwise, bad things may happen! Note that `LDI` instructions require GP Registers `r16` through `r31` as per the instruction set manual.
[^4]: If you need another reason to switch to Microchip Studio, Microchip Studio does this much easier and automatically when you write C code for an AVR microcontroller. Microchip Studios also has no code bloat!

## General Resources

- [Falsehoods that programmers believe in](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) A compendium of many incorrect or problematic assumptions programmers make, and how they can cause software to behave unpredictably or poorly.
- [Glossary of Electrical Engineering Terms](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/glossary.html) Definitions of many frequently used EE terms.
- [How to Read a Schematic](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic) In case you aren‚Äôt sure what all of the circuit symbols mean, here is a handy guide explaining the most common circuit symbols.
- [Sine Lookup Table](https://daycounter.com/Calculators/Sine-Generator-Calculator.phtml) If you‚Äôve ever wanted to generate a sine wave using digital values, use this to create a lookup table of numbers. Using the ATmega328P, you‚Äôll need to build an external DAC (such as an R-2R ladder[^5]) connected to several digital pins.

[^5]: To learn how to build an R-2R ladder, refer to the [Circuit Analysis Lab Manual](https://doctor-pasquale.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ENGIN-2210-Lab-Manual.pdf).
