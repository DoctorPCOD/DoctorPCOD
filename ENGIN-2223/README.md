Sometimes, in lab, you are provided with code to use to learn from, or as a template to build on. Those files will be stored here.

# Uploading code to Arduino using Arduino IDE
1. Write your code in Arduino IDE
2. (Optional) use CONTROL-T (command-T on Mac) to get nice clean auto-formatting
3. Ensure that the Arduino is plugged in to the computer or laptop via USB
4. Ensure that the Arduino IDE is using the correct board information
    1. In the menu, select tools
    2. Select boards
    3. Select Arduino Uno
5. Ensure that the Arduino IDE has the correct port for uploading code
    1. In the menu, select tools
    2. Select port
    3. Select whichever port says Arduino Uno
6. If unsure if the code will work, select Verify (checkmark icon or CONTROL-R)
7. Ensure that your code is properly indented and formatted by using CONTROL-T
8. Before uploading code to the board, ensure that nothing is connected to pin `D0` and pin `D1`
9. If you're sure that the code will work, select Upload (arrow icon or CONTROL-U)
