Sometimes, in lab, you are provided with code to use to learn from, or as a template to build on. Those files will be stored here.

# Uploading code to Arduino using Arduino IDE
1. Write your code in Arduino IDE
2. (Optional) use CONTROL-T (command-T on Mac) to get nice clean auto-formatting
3. Ensure that the Arduino is plugged in to the computer or laptop via USB
4. Ensure that the Arduino IDE is using the correct board information (see screenshot) -- it should be on Arduino Uno

5. Ensure that the Arduino IDE has the correct port for uploading code (see screenshot) -- select whichever port says Arduino Uno

6. If unsure if the code will work, select Verify (checkmark icon or CONTROL-R)
7. Before uploading code to the board, ensure that nothing is connected to pin `D0` and pin `D1`
8. If you're sure that the code will work, select Upload (arrow icon or CONTROL-U)
