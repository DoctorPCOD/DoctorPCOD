- [Lab Manual [PDF]](https://doctor-pasquale.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ENGIN-2223-Lab-Manual.pdf)[^1]
  - You must have a copy of each lab prior to coming to lab.
  - ⚠️ Be sure that the version says Spring 2025.
  - I recommend getting a copy printed using the [COD Library's Print on Demand service](https://library.cod.edu/pod). It is quick and costs only a few dollars!
    - Be sure that you have the appropriate amount of money in your SmartPrint account to expedite the printing process.
    - Select the correct type of paper to print the pages, which is 20# white uncoated paper. If you don't do this, you won't see the actual amount of money the lab manual costs.
- [The doctor-pasquale.com ENGIN-2223 website](https://doctor-pasquale.com/engin-2223/) has additional resources for each lab, as well as the [inventory of parts](https://doctor-pasquale.com/inventory/) and other potentially useful information.
