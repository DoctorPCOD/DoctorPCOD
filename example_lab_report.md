Following is an example lab report that I wrote for Lab 17. This should hopefully give you an example of how detailed to be when writing a lab report for ENGIN-2223.

# Introduction
In this lab, the focus was learning to perform arthmetic operations on numbers that are more than 8 bits using AVR assembly. Specifically, we focused on addition. 

# Procedure and Results

## Circuit I

[Note: this is the circuit description] Circuit 1 displays the binary value of a DIP switch onto eight LEDs. The LEDs only change their values when a pushbutton is pressed, providing a rising-edge to the circuit. [Hardware description] The hardware consisted of a pushbutton connected to pin `A5`. The pushbutton was debounced using the PCB that Dr. P created that uses a resistor and capacitor to filter out high-frequency noise. A DIP switch was used to generate the 8-bit number. The DIP switch was connected to pins `D7`-`D0` and used internal pull-up resistors. Finally, eight LEDs were connected to pins `D8-D13` and `A0` and `A1`. Each one was connected in series with a 220 ohm current-limiting resistor.
