- 👋 Hi, I'm Dr. Pasquale
- 👩🏻‍🏫 I teach engineering and physics at the College of DuPage
- 📚 I’m interested in creating more open educational resources for my classes, and making physics and engineering content for everyone

A lot of my course resources are available on [my website](https://doctor-pasquale.com). I have a lot of educational videos on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSo1hG7F8s-KFSmcNCBavow).
