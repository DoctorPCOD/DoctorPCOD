# About Me

- 👋 Hi, I'm Dr. Pasquale
- 👩🏻‍🏫 I teach engineering and physics at the College of DuPage
- 📚 I’m interested in creating more open educational resources for my classes, and making physics and engineering content for everyone

# DoctorPCOD Repository

This repository is for my ENGIN-2223 (Microcontrollers) class at COD. Have a look around, you never know what you might find.

# My Other Public Repositories

- [microcontrollers-notes](https://github.com/DoctorPCOD/microcontrollers-notes) contains lecture outlines for ENGIN-2223
- [rulesOfTheGame](https://github.com/DoctorPCOD/rulesOfTheGame) is a simulation I wrote in JavaScript (😬!!) for my PHYSI-1100 course of a "simple" game with rules that may be deduced from observing the game multiple times; the simulation randomly simulates game play between two players
