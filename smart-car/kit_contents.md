# Smart Car Kit Contents

Your Smart Car comes from the [SparkFun Inventorâ€™s Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12649), but has been modified with slightly different parts. Notably, you will use an Arduino Uno rather than the Redbot Mainboard.

Here are the parts included in your box:

- Chassis
- [I2C Accelerometer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12589) [^1]
- Bumper (this is a regular contact switch)
- [Line Following Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11769)
- [Geared DC Motors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13302)
- [Wheels](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13259)
- [Wheel Encoders](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12629)

Here are the additional parts that you will need to use in your Smart Car:
- Arduino Uno
- [754410 Quadruple Half H Driver](https://doctor-pasquale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/754410-QUAD-HALF-H-DRIVER.pdf) (h-bridge motor driver)

[^1]: Code for using the accelerometer is [available on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/DoctorPCOD/DoctorPCOD/blob/0585ea07cd37a555d7ef3e248deb2fb208c21c19/smart-car/i2c_accelerometer.ino)
